# Welcome to my github!
## Who am I?
My name's Lydia. I'm a Computer Engineering major with interests in hardware cryptography, cryptanalysis and design, cyber security, computational mathematics, formal methods, and embedded systems design.
## Why CE?
I've majored in CS, Computational Mathematics, Philosophy & Linguistics, and Computer Engineering, and so far CE has given the best mix of the things I liked about each of my previous majors, with more oportunities to tinker and see concrete results from my work, which I find especially rewarding.
## What can I find on your github?
Mostly personal side projects.
